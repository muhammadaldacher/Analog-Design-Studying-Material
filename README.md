# Analog-Design-Studying-Material
Here, I will try to organize all the Analog &amp; Mixed-Signal material I studied from.
1. Analog Design Basics
2. Digital Circuits Basics
3. PLLs (Phase-Locked Loops)
4. ADCs (Analog/Digital Converters)
5. LDOs (Low-Dropout Regulators)
6. RF receiver system
7. IO/SERDES system
